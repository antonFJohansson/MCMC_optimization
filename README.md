# MCMC_optimization
This repo contains code to showcase how MCMC methods can be used for optimization purposes.

Solutions to two different optimization problems are solved by MCMC methods
1. An encryption/decryption example.
2. Travelling salesman

While the solutions are not optimal, they showcase that a general method such as MCMC can yield good solutions with little effort.

* To run the encryption/decryption example. Change the text in the decryption.py file.
* For travelling salesman, run the code in the travelling_salesman.py file.
