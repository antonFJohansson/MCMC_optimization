# MCMC_optimization
This repo contains code to showcase how MCMC methods can be used for optimization purposes.

Solutions to two different optimization problems are solved by MCMC methods
1. An encryption/decryption example.
2. Travelling salesman

While the solutions are not optimal, they showcase that a general method such as MCMC can yield good solutions with little effort.

* To run the encryption/decryption example. Change the text in the decryption.py file. If you want to try this with your own text, please make sure that the text is sufficiently long so that the word statistics of the text can match the source text of the Jane Austen text.
* For travelling salesman, run the code in the travelling_salesman.py file.
